        "Woah, our naïve model is performing best (it's very hard to beat a naïve model in open systems) but the dense model with a horizon of 1 and a window size of 7 looks to be performing cloest.\n",

        "Because of this, let's use `HORIZON=1` and `WINDOW_SIZE=7` for our next series of modelling experiments (in other words, we'll use the previous week of Bitcoin prices to try and predict the next day).\n",
        "\n",
        "> 🔑 **Note:** You might be wondering, why are the naïve results so good? One of the reasons could be due the presence of **autocorrelation** in the data. If a time series has **autocorrelation** it means the value at `t+1` (the next timestep) is typically close to the value at `t` (the current timestep). In other words, today's value is probably pretty close to yesterday's value. Of course, this isn't always the case but when it is, a naïve model will often get fairly good results.\n",
